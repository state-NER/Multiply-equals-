# Multiply Equals

Multiply Equals (MEQ) is a new programming language focused on simplicity, ease of use, and flexibility. It uses unique identifiers such as `ve.uid`, `fio.id`, and `flo.id` to structure objects and actions. It also incorporates unique concepts like `arbitrator.key.ibk` and `Al-Hakam.Library.slad` for control flow and graphic interface creation.

## Features
- Easy syntax for defining variables and actions
- Support for interactive UI elements such as buttons, images, and web structures
- GRPHNO support for graphic novel storytelling

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `lexer.py`, `parser.py`, and `interpreter.py` to start executing your **Multiply Equals** code.

## Example Usage
\`\`\`python
×multiply(.name=atmo;style(×text:×color:green;×size:medium;×background:gray;×edge:rounded)=single text(fio.id))
\`\`\`
